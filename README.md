Allowing shops to have their own personal AI assistant to help them manage their products, which includes customer queries, product descriptions, and shop UI/UX design. The AI assistant will seek to be a salesperson for shops to help them pitch a product to a customer. When customers have certain questions, they can help answer them. To ensure that the AI assistant can answer all questions, during the enabling of the assistant, the AI will act as a customer and seek to ask questions about a product to the shop owner. The AI will consider the shop owner's replies to recreate the product listing, such as the images and descriptions, and suggest an improvement for the owner. Lastly, this is an optional feature. AI can help reorganise products to help them gain more features and spotlight and change the UI.
